# Project Report: Comprehensive Analysis of IPL Data (2008-2024) using Power BI

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to conduct an in-depth analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) data from 2008 to 2024 using Power BI. The analysis focused on key trends and insights that provide valuable information about the IPL's historical performance, including title winners, Orange and Purple Caps, batting and bowling statistics, match outcomes by venue, toss decisions, and result types. The project utilized Power BI’s visualization tools to create interactive dashboards, highlighting trends across 17 IPL seasons.

## Objectives

### 1.	Analyse IPL Title Winners:

Identify the IPL champions from 2008 to 2024, determine the frequency of team victories, and highlight the patterns of winning teams.

### 2.	Orange and Purple Caps Analysis:

Analyse the performance of players who won the Orange Cap (highest run-scorer) and Purple Cap (highest wicket-taker) each season.

### 3.	Batting and Bowling Stats:

Study the batting averages, strike rates, and top performers for each season. Similarly, analyse bowling performance in terms of economy rates, wickets, and best bowling figures.

### 4.	Match Outcomes by Venue:

Investigate how matches concluded at various venues, including home and away factors, and assess the winning trends associated with specific stadiums.

### 5.	Toss Decisions and Impact:

Analyse the outcomes of toss decisions (batting/fielding first) and how they influence match results.

### 6.	Result Types Analysis:

Classify match results based on wins, losses, no results, and ties, and identify trends related to the format of the match (e.g., super overs, rain-affected games).
Data Sources

## The dataset used for the analysis was sourced from multiple reliable platforms, including:

•	Kaggle IPL Datasets (2008-2024)

•	Official IPL Website (for historical data and match summaries)

Data was pre-processed, cleaned, and structured to include relevant columns such as player names, runs, wickets, match outcomes, toss decisions, and venue information.

## Methodology

### 1.	Data Import and Transformation:

Data from various CSV and Excel files were imported into Power BI. Data transformation included:

o	Cleaning missing values

o	Standardizing data formats

o	Merging data sources for a unified dataset

o	Filtering relevant columns (e.g., season, team, player, venue)

### 2.	Data Visualization:  
Using Power BI, a series of visualizations were created to identify key trends:

o	Card Visual to show IPL title winners and Orange/Purple Cap winners and display batting and bowling stats over the years.

o	Stacked bar charts to show match outcomes by venue.

o	 Donut charts for result types and toss decisions.

### 3.	Interactive Dashboards:

Interactive dashboards were designed to allow users to drill down into specific seasons or categories. Filters were added to allow dynamic changes based on teams, players, venues, or seasons.

## Key Findings

### 1.	Title Winners Trends:

o	The most successful teams in the IPL, in terms of title wins, include Mumbai Indians (MI) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK), with MI winning 5 titles and CSK winning 5.

o	The frequency of different teams winning the title has fluctuated, with dominant teams like MI and CSK emerging more frequently in the later years.

### 2.	Orange and Purple Cap Performers:

o	The Orange Cap (awarded to the top run-scorer) has been dominated by players like Virat Kohli, David Warner, and Shane Watson across different seasons.

o	The Purple Cap (awarded to the top wicket-taker) has been frequently claimed by Dwayne Bravo, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and Harshal Patel.

### 3.	Batting and Bowling Stats:

o	Top Batsmen: The analysis highlighted consistent top performers such as Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle, and Rohit Sharma with the highest batting averages and strike rates.

o	Top Bowlers: Leading wicket-takers included Yuzvendra Chahal, Dwayne Bravo, and Sunil Narine, who have maintained impressive economy rates and wickets.

### 4.	Match Outcomes by Venue:

o	Some venues like the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Eden Gardens  in Kolkata and the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore were found to have a higher win percentage for the Chasing teams.

### 5.	Toss Decisions and Impact:

o	Teams choosing to chase after winning the toss were found to have a slight advantage in terms of match outcomes, especially in the initial years when dew played a significant factor.

o	The bat-first decision showed varied results, with the ability to set a high target in the first innings being crucial.

## Conclusion

The analysis provided a comprehensive view of the trends and performances across 17 seasons of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The visualizations created in Power BI offered an interactive approach to understanding key aspects like title wins, player performances, and match outcomes. The insights derived from this analysis can assist IPL franchises, players, and analysts in making data-driven decisions for future seasons.
